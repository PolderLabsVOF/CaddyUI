A friendly web UI for managing your Caddyfile, proxies, snippets, logs, users, and updates.

Because editing reverse proxy configs by hand is fun right up until it is not.

## Quick install

### paste this into your caddy machine for a guided install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrB0rk/CaddyUI/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```


When the installer finishes, it prints your onboarding URL.

Run the same command again later to update CaddyUI.


## Active development warning

CaddyUI is under active development. Things move quickly, and some parts may still change between versions.

Release channels:

- `main` is the stable release lane
- `beta` is for pre-release testing
- `dev` gets the newest changes first and may be less predictable

Use `stable` if you want the calm path. Use `beta` or `dev` if you want newer features and do not mind the occasional sharp edge.



## What you get

- Manage reverse proxies from the UI
- Add, edit, enable, disable, and delete proxy entries
- Create and manage Caddy snippets/middlewares
- Monaco-powered editors for raw config and entries
- Validate your config with `caddy validate`
- Reload Caddy after changes
- View logs from files and `journalctl`
- Built-in user authentication
- Role-based access: `view`, `edit`, and `admin`
- Security settings: trusted proxy hops, cookie mode, setup exposure, allowed origins
- Config apply modes: file mode (write Caddyfile) or API mode (push via Caddy Admin API)
- Onboarding with Caddyfile and log discovery
- Self-updates from `stable`, `beta`, or `dev`

## How it works

CaddyUI reads your configured Caddy config, parses your sites, proxies, and imports, then shows them in a web interface.

When you apply changes:
- In `file` mode, CaddyUI writes to your configured `Caddyfile`, validates the result with `caddy validate`, and can reload Caddy.
- In `api` mode, CaddyUI pushes config through the Caddy Admin API and keeps a working config cache for the editor.

It also handles onboarding, authentication, user roles, log discovery, update channel selection, and runtime security settings.

In API mode, CaddyUI exposes an authenticated Caddy API bridge under `/api/caddy/*`:
- `POST /api/caddy/load`, `POST /api/caddy/adapt`, `POST /api/caddy/stop`
- `GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE /api/caddy/config[/{path}]`
- `GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE /api/caddy/id/:id[/{path}]`
- `GET /api/caddy/pki/ca/:id`, `GET /api/caddy/pki/ca/:id/certificates`
- `GET /api/caddy/reverse_proxy/upstreams`

## Onboarding

The first-time setup walks you through:

1. Creating an admin user
2. Entering the setup token, if required
3. Selecting a detected Caddyfile or entering a path manually
4. Selecting detected log files or adding log paths manually

## Switch config mode in Settings

1. Open **Settings**.
2. In **Caddy configuration**, set **Config mode** to `file` or `api`.
3. For `file` mode, set a readable/writable `Caddyfile path`.
4. For `api` mode, set `Caddy API URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:2019`) and optional `Caddy API secret`.
5. Click **Save**.

Notes:
- In API mode, Caddy API defaults can also come from `CADDY_UI_CADDY_API_URL` and `CADDY_UI_CADDY_API_TOKEN`.
- The API secret is stored server-side; the UI only reports whether one is configured.

## Security note

- In production (`NODE_ENV=production`), set `CADDY_UI_SECRET` to a strong value (at least 32 characters), or the server will refuse to start.

## UI pages

- **Proxies**  
  Manage proxy entries with grouping, search, sorting, imports, logging, tags, and categories.

- **Middlewares**  
  Create, edit, and delete reusable Caddy snippets.

- **Configuration**  
  Edit the full raw config directly (from `Caddyfile` in file mode, or working config cache in API mode).

- **Logs**  
  View Caddy logs from configured files and `journalctl`.

- **Settings**  
  Configure config mode (`file`/`api`), API URL/secret, paths, scans, users, passwords, update channel, and security options.

## Reverse proxy example

```caddyfile
caddyui.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
}
```
